GPT Model from Scratch

Welcome to the repository for building a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from scratch. This project was developed as part of the "Zero to Hero in Neural Networks" course by Andrej Karpathy. The goal is to provide a hands-on understanding of how modern language models like GPT are constructed and trained.

Overview

This project involves implementing a GPT model from scratch using Python and PyTorch. The model is trained on the tiny Shakespeare dataset, which includes all works of Shakespeare concatenated into a single file. The goal is to generate text that mimics Shakespearean language.

Implementation Details

Programming Language: Python
Framework: PyTorch
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Training Data: Tiny Shakespeare dataset (~1MB)
Parameters: The model is trained with 124 million parameters, similar to the early GPT-2 model.
Model Architecture

The model is based on the Transformer architecture introduced in the "Attention is All You Need" paper. Key components include:

Position encodings
Token encodings
Transformer blocks
Layer normalization
Final linear layer
Training Process

The training process involves two main stages:

Pre-training: The model is pre-trained on the tiny Shakespeare dataset to model the sequence of characters.
Fine-tuning: The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned for specific tasks to improve its performance.
Tokenization

A character-level tokenizer is used to convert the text into integers. This approach keeps the implementation simple and effective.

Dataset

The tiny Shakespeare dataset is used for training. It consists of all works of Shakespeare concatenated into a single file, totaling about 1MB in size.

Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

Python 3.7+
PyTorch
Jupyter Notebook
Install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch jupyter
Usage

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpt-from-scratch.git

bash
Copy code
cd gpt-from-scratch
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run the notebook cells to train the model and generate text.
Results

The trained model generates text that mimics Shakespearean language. While it is not perfect, it provides a clear demonstration of how GPT models work.

Key Learnings

Through this project, I have gained:

A deep understanding of Transformer architecture.
Practical knowledge of training and fine-tuning language models.
Experience with tokenization methods and their impact on model performance.
